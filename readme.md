```

## Configuration

We don't configure packages in our bundle to let you customize it for your needs.
You could see one of our project as example [SoIngenious](https://github.com/Sowapps/symfony-so-ingenious-demo/tree/main/config/packages).
Below the configuration the bundle is requiring to work properly.

For local classic usage, we comment the whole file.

# Override

First, have a look on this page: https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/override.html

## Controllers

Extends our controller and write route to your own

## Templates

Put your template in /templates/bundles/SoCoBundle/ by respecting given hierarchy, you may extend our template to replace blocks only.

## Doctrine Custom types

Replace type in your doctrine configuration by your class. Extends our class and add more values for an enum.

## Stimulus controllers

Add controllers to the `assets/controllers.json` file under `@sowapps/so-core`

# Develop

## Webpack

For now, only `yarn add file:../so-core-bundle/assets;` works, but updating source requires to restart watch.
The package is in assets folder to prevent embedding all the bundle in the node module.

H:\Workspaces\git\so-core-bundle

/!\ It does not work, packages sources does not find any module

Link your package using yarn
See https://benjaminwfox.com/blog/tech/why-isnt-npm-link-working

In the package assets/ folder, run

`yarn link`

Now, your package is available in any project but as a symlink instead of a remote repository.

In your project folder, run

``yarn link @sowapps/so-core``

## Stimulus controllers

Create your controllers in `assets/controllers`

Declare them in `assets/package.json`

Use it as `@sowapps--so-core--name` with name the given name in package.json
